# ðŸ’» Microsoft Website Clone

## Description

Clone of the Microsoft Website Landing page. This project was created following Traversy Media tutorial on YouTube.

It is built in HTML and CSS. 

I love clone projects like this because they help me better understand the use of HTML and CSS Grid/Flexbox in a real-world environment.
This one in particular is also completely responsive so I've learned how to use different media queries in CSS.
